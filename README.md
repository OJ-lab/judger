Judger is supposed to be a simple **sandbox service** which works for online-judge systems.

## System

Judger currently use `nix` to make necessary system invoke like `fork()`.
So you might need to check whether you are using the supported system from the main-page of [nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix).

**Briefly speaking, judger-rs is now supposing you are decided to run it on linux.**
We'll consider other platform, but in a lower priority.

## Development

Judger should works fine in VSCode with all recommended extensions installed.

### Before you start

You may need to setup your environment before you start.
There is a setup script to help you quickly get ready.

> ðŸ¥° You won't need to run this script if you are using GitHub Codespaces.

```sh
./scripts/env_setup.bash
```
